# DataScience-Capstone Project

Welcome to the Next Word Predictor app.

This app is developed as the final project for the Coursera Data Science Capstone course. The main goal of this capstone project is to build a Shiny application that is able to predict the next word.

The app is hosted on [ShinyApps.io](https://dalalbhargav07.shinyapps.io/Predict_Next_Word/)

The R Presentation is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/dalalbhargav07/capstone_project).

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available in my [GitHub repository](hhttps://github.com/dalalbhargav07/DataScience-Capstone/).
